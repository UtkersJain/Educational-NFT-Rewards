# Educational NFT Rewards

## Project Description
The Educational NFT Rewards smart contract is designed to incentivize educational progress and engagement by rewarding holders of specific educational NFTs. Users earn `EduToken` (EDU) rewards for holding these NFTs, with rewards accumulating over time and being claimable at any point. The system is decentralized, secure, and encourages lifelong learning.
